Time table of Classes 
-------------
Teachers and lab coordinators will give the preferences of their teaching subjects and labs and you need to auto generate the time table with required classes and labs.
Teachers should not exceed 35 hrs of class and lab schedule across a week. 
You need to consider lab rooms and duration and should not collide with occupied rooms/labs.

If teachers have primary and secondary preferences you should honor the primary preference more and in case if primary is not suffice then use secondary preferences.

2nd level: 

You should give primary and backup for all class schedule
Consider if teacher is having the class with other years class time table and should not collide with schedule of other years and other departments.
Give with room details like class room and shared class room and seminar halls and labs.

Inputs: Teachers preferences, Year/Semester classes and labs and subject and lab rooms and lab duration
Output: Time table for classes and labs with backups for classes
